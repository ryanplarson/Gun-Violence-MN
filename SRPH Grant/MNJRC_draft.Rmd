# Introduction

## MPD Murder of George Floyd

- highly publicized police murder of Mr. George Floyd on May 25th, 2005
  - in part catalyzed the growing #Blacklivesmatter movement
  - sparked sustained protests locally and around the world
- Much talk about increases in homicide and gun violence in this period (Star Tribune)
- This event and ensuing unrest led us to consider...
  - What does the timing look like (e.g., when did increases happen?)
  - What explains these increases?
  - What else has an event of this magnitude impacted (e.g., health?)
    - to what extent has it done so in an unequal fashion?

## Broad Research Questions

- What has been the public health impact of this police murder?
  - firearm assault injury incidence?
  - mental health diagnoses?
  - differentially based on race and space?
- How does police violence generally impact public health?
  - how is police violence shaped by legacies of structural racism?
  
## Roadmap

- **Part 1**: The Effects of The Police Murder on Public Health
  - firearm assault injury (Larson et al. 2023)
  - mental health hospital incidence (Santaularia et al. *under review*)
- **Part 2**: Historical Structural Racism, Police Shootings, and Health
  - new, fresh proposed research
- **Part 3**: Strategies of Resilience and Racial Healing in Minneapolis
- **Part 4**: Questions and Discussion
  - *what ideas do you have to inform our continued research*
  - *what questions should we be asking?*

# Tracing the Public Health Consequences: Work Completed

## Literature Review: Gun Injury

- Why would we expect an uptick in gun injury after the murder?
  - pandemic explanation 
    - weakening of social bonds, heightened visibilities of existing vulnerabilities (Wrigley-Field et al. 2020)
  - depolicing explanation (Shjarback et al. 2017)
  - augmentation of legal estrangement (Bell 2017)
    - bolstering feelings of distrust in legal institutions and feelings of structural social exclusion
  
## Literature Review: Mental Health Diagnoses

- mental health effects of *exposure* to police violence 
  - general anxiety and depression (Geller et al. 2014; Alang et al. 2021)
  - suicide attempts (DeVylder 2017)
  - anticipation of future police violence (Salas-Hernandez et a. 2022)
- general health effects extend beyond direct exposure (DeVylder et al. 2022; Haile et al. 2023)
- exposure to police killing associated with .14 additional poor mental health days per months for Black individuals (Venkataramani et al. 2018)
  - no increase for White individuals 


## Research Questions

- Did firearm assault injuries increase after the police murder of Mr. Floyd?
  - if so, was there spatial variation in this increase?
  - if so, does pandemic policy or changes in policing explain the increase?
- Did mental health diagnoses increase after the police murder of Mr. Floyd?
  - if so, amongst which racial groups?
  - if so, where was there spatial variation in the increase?

## Data

- Outcome Variables (Minnesota Hospital Association Data)
  - firearm assault injury rate per 100,000
  - mental health diagnoses per 1,000
- Focal Predictor Variables
  - time trend, event indicator, post-event time trend
- Time Varying Controls
  - pandemic policy (stay at home, state of emergency)
  - weather (MN DNR)
  - amount of darkness before 12am (`suncalc` in R)
  - proportion school days (Minneapolis Public Schools)
  - MPD Use of Force (lag)
  - MPD Stops (lag)
  - MPD Officer Involved Shootings (lag)
  - Median Household Income
  - Percent Black
  - concentrated disadvantage

## Conclusions

- the police murder of Mr. Floyd
  - increased firearm assault injury incidence
    - larger increases in ZCTAs with higher percent Black population
    - increase not explained by COVID-19 policy or "depolicing"
  - increased mental health diagnoses in Minneapolis
    - increase concentrated amongst Black residents
    - increase was global for Black residents (increase for White residents in areas of higher concentrated disadvantage)

# Structural Racism, Police Violence, and Health: Work Ahead

## Introduction: Police Violence

- police shootings
  - In 2023 (thus far...), 915 people fatally shot by police (Mapping Police Violence 2023)
  - unarmed Black person about 3.5x more likely to be shot that an unarmed White person (Ross 2015)
  - lifetime risk of being killed by police 1 in 1,000 for Black men (Edwards et al. 2018)
    - ~2.5 higher risk as compared White men
  - racial disparities as well in use of force generally (Knox et al. 2020)
  
## Introduction: Structural Racism and Police Violence

- historical practices of structural racial exclusion
  - redlining ("HOLC Grades")
    - ranged from "A" to "D" and process of assignment highly racialized (Faber 2020)
    - effectively conflated race and "financial risk" 
  - racial covenants
    - clauses inserted into property deeds to prevent non-White individuals from owning or renting space
- Individuals in lower HOLC graded areas experience worse contemporary health outcomes
  - physical and mental health (Lynch et al. 2021), life expectancy (Graetz et al. 2022), etc.
- redlined spaces linked to higher incidence of fatal encounters with police (Mitchell and Chiahay 2022)
  
## Introduction: Police Violence and Health

- direct health related concerns (e.g., morality, injury)
- health effects of *exposure* to police violence 
  - general anxiety and depression (Geller et al. 2014; Alang et al. 2021)
  - suicide attempts (DeVylder 2017)
  - anticipation of future police violence (Salas-Hernandez et a. 2022)
- general health effects extend beyond direct exposure (DeVylder et al. 2022; Haile et al. 2023)

## Research Questions

- **RQ1**: What's impact of historical redlining and racial covenants on police shootings?
  - net of current homicide rates and other factors
- **RQ2**: What's the impact of police shootings on health?
  - firearm assault injury, mental health, substance use, suicide, etc.
- **RQ3**: Do police shootings mediate the relationship between structural racism and health outcomes?
- **RQ4**: What are the mechanisms by which police shootings effect health outcomes? What are strategies of resilience used by community members and how do these strategies shape these processes?

## Theoretical Model

![](dag.png){height=85%, width=85%}

## Data: Quantitative

- Key Exposures (Mapping Prejudice Project)
  - presence of redlining in ZCTA 
  - presence of racial covenants in ZCTA
- Key Outcomes (Minnesota Hospital Association Data)
  - health diagnoses per 1,000
- Key Mediator (OpenMinneapolis)
  - rate of police shootings
- Controls
  - Pre-Exposure demographics and economic structure (1930 Census Data)
  - contemporary demographics and economic structure (2000-2006 Census Data)

## Redlining in Minneapolis and St. Paul

## Racial Covenants in Minneapolis and St. Paul

## Mixed Method Design: Quantitative

- modeling the relationship between historical exposure to redlining/racial covenants and contemporary police shootings
  - spatial lag autocorrelation (AR) models adjusting for historical demographics
- modeling the relationship between police shootings and health outcomes
  - two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model on panel data from 2008-2023
- modeling the relationship between historical exposure to redlining/racial covenants and health outcomes
  - testing for a mediation effect of police shootings using a counterfactual mediation approach (Graetz et al. 2022)

## Mixed Method Design: Qualitative
